# balsa
The lightweight base material for building things.

This is a cleanup of [core](https://github.com/mtao/core) with a less egotistical namespace, a focus on Qt and Vulkan, and using meson to clean up the build process. The visualization / scenegraph system borrows heavily from [magnum](https://magnum.graphics) - I'm trying do a concept-heavy vulkan-focused variant of it.
